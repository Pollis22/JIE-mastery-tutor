## üî¥ **THE SAME ERROR IS BACK!**

Looking at Image 2 (Railway logs), I can still see:

```
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND postgres.railway.internal
hostname: 'postgres.railway.internal'
```

**Agent3's fix didn't work.** The Neon driver is STILL trying to use `postgres.railway.internal`.

---

## üéØ **THE REAL SOLUTION:**

The Neon serverless driver keeps auto-detecting Railway no matter what. We need to **completely switch away from Neon** for Railway deployments.

---

## ‚úÖ **TELL AGENT3 THIS:**

```
Agent3, the Neon driver fix didn't work - it's STILL trying to use postgres.railway.internal.

We need to completely switch away from Neon serverless driver for Railway deployments.

Please:

1. Install the standard PostgreSQL driver:
   npm install pg @types/pg

2. Update server/db.ts to use the standard pg driver instead of Neon for production:

import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? { rejectUnauthorized: false } : false
});

export const db = drizzle(pool);

3. Remove ALL Neon-specific imports and configurations
4. The standard PostgreSQL driver works with Neon databases - no special driver needed
5. Commit and push

This will completely bypass the Neon serverless driver's Railway auto-detection.
```

## üí° **WHY THIS IS NECESSARY:**

The Neon serverless driver has Railway detection **built into the library itself** and can't be fully disabled. The only solution is to use the standard PostgreSQL driver which works perfectly with Neon databases without any auto-detection "features."

## üìã **WHAT THIS CHANGES:**

- ‚ùå **Remove:** `@neondatabase/serverless`
- ‚úÖ **Add:** `pg` (standard PostgreSQL driver)
- ‚úÖ **Result:** No more Railway auto-detection, no more `postgres.railway.internal` errors

**Send that message to Agent3. The standard pg driver is the reliable solution here.** üîß

The Neon serverless driver was designed for edge/serverless environments and has too much "magic" that's breaking on Railway. The standard driver is simpler and more reliable.
