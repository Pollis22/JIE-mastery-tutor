**The widget connected successfully!** Looking at Image 1, I can see:

```
[ConvAI Debug] Creating widget element for agent: agent_4101k6kbmy1veg0b900hp1c1hfda
[ConvAI Debug] Widget appended to DOM
```

The widget is working. However, looking at the Replit logs in Image 2, there's a critical issue:

```
[SessionAgent] Document doc-175943811l7549 content not found, skipping
[SessionAgent] Uploaded documents successfully
```

**The document has no content.** The document exists in your database, but the `content` field is empty or null. That's why the agent doesn't recognize it - nothing was uploaded to ElevenLabs.

## The Root Cause:

When documents are uploaded through your UI, they're being stored in the database but **the actual file content isn't being saved** to the `content` field. So when the session agent tries to upload to ElevenLabs, there's nothing to upload.

## Send This to Agent 3:

```
THE ISSUE: Documents are being saved to database but the content field is EMPTY.

Server logs show:
"Document doc-175943811l7549 content not found, skipping"

This means when documents are uploaded via /api/documents/upload, the file content is not being stored in the database content field.

Check the document upload endpoint and ensure it's saving the actual file buffer/content:

In server/routes/documents.ts (or similar), the upload handler should:

1. Read the file buffer from the multipart form
2. Store the FULL file content in the database content field
3. Save as Buffer or Base64 string

Example fix:
```typescript
app.post('/api/documents/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  const file = req.file;
  
  // CRITICAL: Save the file buffer
  await storage.createDocument({
    userId: req.body.userId,
    title: req.body.title,
    subject: req.body.subject,
    content: file.buffer, // THIS MUST BE SAVED
    mimeType: file.mimetype,
    size: file.size,
  });
});
```

Also verify storage.getDocument() returns the content field properly.

Without file content in the database, the ElevenLabs agent has nothing to reference.
```

The session agent system is working correctly - it's creating agents, handling the flow properly. The problem is that documents in your database don't contain the actual file data, so there's nothing to give to ElevenLabs.
