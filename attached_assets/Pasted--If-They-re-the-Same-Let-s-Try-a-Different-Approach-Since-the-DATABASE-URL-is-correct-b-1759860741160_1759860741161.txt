## ü§î **If They're the Same, Let's Try a Different Approach**

Since the DATABASE_URL is correct but the app is still trying to connect to `postgres.railway.internal`, the issue might be in how the code is handling the database connection.

---

## üîß **SOLUTION: Tell Agent3 to Fix the Database Connection**

The app is crashing because it's trying to connect to the database **immediately on startup**. Let's make it more resilient:

**Tell Agent3:**

```
Agent3, the Railway deployment is failing because the database connection crashes the server on startup.

The error shows: "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND postgres.railway.internal"

Please update server/db.ts to:

1. Make the database connection LAZY (don't connect on import/startup)
2. Add better error handling so the server can start even if DB connection fails temporarily
3. Only connect to the database when a route actually needs it
4. Log the DATABASE_URL being used (first 20 characters only for security) to verify it's correct

The server should START FIRST and respond to health checks, THEN connect to database on first use.
```

## üéØ **ALTERNATIVE QUICK TEST:**

Let's verify it's not a DATABASE_URL issue by checking what's actually in the variable:

**Can you:**

1. Go to **Variables tab** in your JIE-mastery-tutor service
2. Click on **DATABASE_URL** to view it
3. **Take a screenshot** (you can blur out the password part)
4. Verify it shows the full connection string starting with `postgresql://` and NOT any reference syntax

---

## üí° **WHAT'S LIKELY HAPPENING:**

Your code is probably doing this:
```typescript
// server/db.ts
const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL); // Connects immediately
```

It needs to be:
```typescript
// server/db.ts
let db = null;

export function getDB() {
  if (!db) {
    db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  }
  return db;
}
```

This way, the server can start and respond to requests, and only connects to the database when actually needed.

**Either send that message to Agent3 to fix the database connection handling, OR share a screenshot of what the DATABASE_URL variable actually shows in Railway.** üîç
