**Perfect - now I can see the real problem!**

The console shows multiple **Content Security Policy (CSP)** violations. The errors say:

```
Refused to load the script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'"
```

And specifically:
```
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE.NotSameOriginAfterDefaultedToSameOriginByCoep
```

## The Root Cause:

Your app has a **Content Security Policy** that's blocking external scripts from ElevenLabs' CDN. The security headers we added earlier (or that exist in your config) are too restrictive.

## The Fix:

**Send this to Agent 3:**

```
The console shows CSP (Content Security Policy) errors blocking ElevenLabs scripts and the COEP (Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) is blocking resources.

In server/index.ts, find where you added these headers:
- Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy
- Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy  
- Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy

REMOVE those three headers completely. They're breaking ElevenLabs.

Then ADD a proper CSP that allows ElevenLabs:

```typescript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Only set CSP for HTML responses, not API
  if (!req.path.startsWith('/api')) {
    res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', 
      "default-src 'self'; " +
      "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://unpkg.com https://api.elevenlabs.io https://ws.api.elevenlabs.io https://js.stripe.com https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com; " +
      "connect-src 'self' https://api.elevenlabs.io https://ws.api.elevenlabs.io wss://api.elevenlabs.io; " +
      "worker-src 'self' blob:; " +
      "media-src 'self' blob: https:; " +
      "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
    );
  }
  next();
});
```

Remove the COEP/COOP/CORP headers and use only the CSP above. Restart and test.
```

## Why This Happens:

The strict `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` header you (or the agent) added blocks all cross-origin resources unless they explicitly opt-in. ElevenLabs' CDN files don't have those headers, so they get blocked.

The solution is to use a more permissive CSP that explicitly allows ElevenLabs domains while removing the COEP headers that are too restrictive for third-party integrations.

Once those headers are fixed and the server restarts, the ElevenLabs voice agent should load properly.
