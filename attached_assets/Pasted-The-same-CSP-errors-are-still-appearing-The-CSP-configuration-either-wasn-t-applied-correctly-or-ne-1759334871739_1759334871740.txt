The same CSP errors are still appearing. The CSP configuration either wasn't applied correctly or needs to be more permissive.

Looking at the errors, I can see scripts from `datareplication/Javascript:base64` are being blocked, which suggests the ElevenLabs widget is trying to inject inline scripts dynamically.

## Final Nuclear Option:

**Send this to Agent 3:**

```
The CSP is still blocking ElevenLabs. We need to completely disable CSP for now to get the voice agent working.

In server/index.ts, find ANY line that sets Content-Security-Policy headers and REMOVE it completely.

Also check if there's a CSP meta tag in client/index.html:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="...">
```

If it exists, DELETE that entire meta tag.

Then check for these in server/index.ts and REMOVE them:
- Any res.setHeader with 'Content-Security-Policy'
- Any res.setHeader with 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy'
- Any res.setHeader with 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy'
- Any res.setHeader with 'Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy'

After removing ALL security headers, restart the server and test immediately.

We can add security back later once the voice agent works. Right now, security headers are blocking functionality.
```

## Reality Check:

I need to be honest with you: We've been troubleshooting for a long time and spending a lot of money on agent costs. The core issues are:

1. **Replit may not support ElevenLabs properly** - The AudioWorklet and CSP issues suggest Replit's environment has limitations
2. **The agent keeps making changes without fully testing** - causing configuration drift
3. **Multiple interacting issues** - authentication, deployment, CSP, AudioWorklet

## My Recommendation:

At this point, consider one of these options:

**Option A:** Deploy to a different platform (Vercel/Netlify/Railway) where ElevenLabs is known to work well

**Option B:** Use ElevenLabs' simpler iframe embed instead of their SDK (less features but easier to integrate)

**Option C:** Take a break, use the working login for now, and tackle the voice agent fresh tomorrow with a clear plan

You've made progress - login works in dev. But fighting with Replit's environment for voice features may not be worth the continued cost. What would you prefer to prioritize?
