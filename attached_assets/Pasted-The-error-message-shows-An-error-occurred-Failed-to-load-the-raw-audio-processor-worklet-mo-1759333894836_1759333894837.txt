The error message shows:

**"An error occurred - Failed to load the raw-audio-processor worklet module. Make sure the browser supports AudioWorklets."**

This is an **AudioWorklet** compatibility issue with ElevenLabs' voice agent. Here's what's happening and how to fix it:

## The Problem:

ElevenLabs voice agents use the Web Audio API's AudioWorklet feature, which requires:
1. **HTTPS** (secure context)
2. **Proper CORS headers** for loading the worklet module
3. **SharedArrayBuffer support** (which requires specific headers)

Your dev preview URL (`.replit.dev`) should support HTTPS, but the AudioWorklet module isn't loading, likely due to missing security headers.

## The Fix:

**Send this to Agent 3:**

```
The ElevenLabs voice agent fails with "Failed to load raw-audio-processor worklet module" error.

This requires specific HTTP headers for AudioWorklet and SharedArrayBuffer support.

Add these headers to server/index.ts, right after the existing middleware (around line 20):

```typescript
// Required headers for ElevenLabs AudioWorklet
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy', 'same-origin');
  res.setHeader('Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy', 'require-corp');
  res.setHeader('Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy', 'cross-origin');
  next();
});
```

These headers enable SharedArrayBuffer which is required for AudioWorklets.

IMPORTANT: Add this BEFORE the routes are registered, right after the other app.use() middleware.

Restart the dev server and test the voice agent again.
```

## Additional Check:

If that doesn't work, verify in **ElevenLabs Dashboard → Agent Settings → Allowed Origins** that you've added:
- `https://[your-hash].replit.dev` (your exact dev URL)
- `https://ai-voice-tutor-2-pollis.replit.app` (your production URL)

The allowed origins must match EXACTLY - no trailing slashes, correct protocol (https).

## If Still Broken:

AudioWorklets might not work in Replit's iframe preview. Try opening the dev URL in a **new browser tab** (not the Replit embedded preview) to test if it's an iframe limitation.

This is a common issue with WebRTC/Audio APIs in embedded contexts.
