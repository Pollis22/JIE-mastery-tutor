Good - you're now in a separate browser tab (not the Replit iframe), and the allowlist is configured correctly in ElevenLabs. But the AudioWorklet error persists.

The issue is that the security headers I mentioned need to be added, but there's a **conflict**: those headers (`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`) will **break** loading external resources like ElevenLabs' SDK unless everything is properly configured.

## Different Approach - Use ElevenLabs' Signed URLs:

The AudioWorklet issue often happens because ElevenLabs needs to load its processor from their CDN. Instead of fighting with CORP headers, let's check if your implementation is correct.

**Send this to Agent 3:**

```
The AudioWorklet error means the ElevenLabs SDK can't load its audio processor module. This is a known issue with their ConvAI SDK.

Check your ElevenLabs integration code (likely in client/src/components or client/src/pages):

1. Verify you're using the LATEST ElevenLabs SDK version:
```typescript
// Should be using @11ty/elevenlabs-convai or similar latest version
import { Conversation } from '@11ty/elevenlabs-convai';
```

2. Make sure the agent ID is correct (from the screenshot: agent_0101k6691t1ew6bcfm3396wfhza)

3. The initialization should look like:
```typescript
const conversation = await Conversation.startSession({
  agentId: 'agent_0101k6691t1ew6bcfm3396wfhza',
  // Add this if missing:
  overrides: {
    agent: {
      prompt: {
        llm: 'gpt-4'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

4. Check browser console for the EXACT error - click on the red error text and screenshot the full stack trace.

The "raw-audio-processor" error specifically means the AudioWorklet module failed to load. This could be:
- Wrong SDK version
- Missing permissions in browser
- CORS issue with ElevenLabs CDN

Show me the exact ElevenLabs integration code and the full error from console.
```

## Quick Test:

Open browser DevTools â†’ Console tab, and type:
```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
```

If this fails or asks for permission, that's part of the problem - you need microphone access granted before ElevenLabs can initialize.

The error might not be fixable on Replit if AudioWorklets don't work properly in their environment. You may need to deploy to a different platform (Vercel, Netlify, Railway) for the voice features to work reliably.
