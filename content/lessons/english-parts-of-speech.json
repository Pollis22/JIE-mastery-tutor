  "concepts": [
    "Nouns are words that name people, places, things, or ideas",
    "Verbs are action words that tell us what someone or something does",
    "Every sentence needs at least one noun and one verb",
    "Nouns can be concrete (you can touch them) or abstract (ideas/feelings)",
    "Verbs can show action (run, jump) or state of being (is, are)"
